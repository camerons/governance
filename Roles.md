# Roles
## Informal roles

### Community
Everyone contributing to, or using templates from, the TheGoodDocsProject is considered part of our community. We encourage all community members to actively participate in our discussions and vote on motions.
Community members are expected to be respectful to each other, in line with our [Code of Conduct](CodeOfConduct).

### Users
Users apply our documentation templates within their own projects.

### Contributors
Contributors give a bit more,  participating in discussions, suggesting improvements, providing patches, and so on.

## Formal roles

### Committers
A committer is a trusted contributor who has additionally been given write access to the project repository by the Project Steering Committee.

**Expectations of committers:**

Understand and apply our quality guidelines 
Understand and abide by our license requirements.
Ideally, monitor conversations on our email list and contribute constructively where appropriate - especially in relation to contributions from the committer.

### Project Steering Committee (PSC)
The Project Steering Committee (PSC) is the official managing body for our project and is responsible for setting overall project direction. The committee is drawn from the community and is based on merit and interest.
A PSC chair shall be selected from the PSC, with the only official extra duty being that they have a deciding vote in the case of a tied vote of the PSC.

**Expectations of PSC members:**

* Regularly contribute to the project.
* Help with whatever unglamourous work is required to keep the project moving forward.
* Monitor conversations on our email list and contribute constructively where appropriate. 
* Optionally attend weekly meetings.
* Vote promptly (within days) to motions being raised.

## Selection of formal roles
Selection of new Committers and PSC members is determined by PSC vote. Committers and PSC members may retire any time. If a Committer or PSC member becomes inactive for many months they may be invited to retire, and if unresponsive they may be removed by the existing PSC.
