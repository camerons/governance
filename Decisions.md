# Decisions

## Voting

Decisions are based on voting using the following:

* +1 : For
* +0: Mildly for, but mostly indifferent
* 0: Indifferent
* -0: Mildly against, but mostly indifferent
* -1 : Strongly against. This is expected to be accompanied by a reason.

For most decisions, a motion is raised within one of TheGoodDocsProject open forums (slack, email list, etc) and those present vote and decide. 

## Contentious decisions

Should a decision:

* Be strategic or impact many within the project,
* Or if there is contention in deciding, and after discussion at least one member is still strongly against the motion, by continuing to vote -1,

then the motion should be referred to the PSC (via our email list).

For contentious motions presented to the PSC, a motion is considered passed when there are more PSC +1 votes than -1 votes, and either all PSC members have voted, or 4 days have passed. In the case of a tie, the PSC chair shall have 1.5 votes.

## Record decisions

All decisions should be forwarded to our email list to provide the rest of the community with the opportunity to vote. 
The results of decisions should be captured in our decision register: <https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/governance/wiki/Decision-Log-2020>
